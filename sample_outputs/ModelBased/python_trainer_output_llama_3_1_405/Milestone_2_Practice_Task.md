**Mathematical Foundations for AI and ML: Practice Task**
===========================================================

**Concept Explanations**
------------------------

Before diving into the practice task, it's essential to understand the key concepts related to linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory in the context of AI and ML.

### Linear Algebra for AI and ML

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces, linear transformations, and matrices. In AI and ML, linear algebra is used extensively for tasks such as:

* Data representation: Vectors and matrices are used to represent data in a compact and efficient manner.
* Data transformation: Linear transformations are used to transform data from one space to another.
* Neural networks: Linear algebra is used to represent the weights and biases of neural networks.

Key concepts:

* **Vectors**: A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude (length) and direction.
* **Matrices**: A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers, symbols, or expressions.
* **Linear transformations**: A linear transformation is a function that maps one vector space to another while preserving the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create two vectors
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Add the two vectors
result = v1 + v2
print(result)  # Output: [5 7 9]
```

### Calculus for Optimization

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of continuous change. In AI and ML, calculus is used extensively for optimization tasks such as:

* Minimizing the loss function of a neural network
* Maximizing the likelihood of a probabilistic model

Key concepts:

* **Derivatives**: A derivative measures the rate of change of a function with respect to one of its variables.
* **Gradients**: A gradient is a vector of partial derivatives of a function with respect to each of its variables.

Example:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define a function
x = sp.symbols('x')
f = x**2 + 3*x + 2

# Compute the derivative of the function
f_prime = sp.diff(f, x)
print(f_prime)  # Output: 2*x + 3
```

### Probability Theory for AI and ML

Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of chance events. In AI and ML, probability theory is used extensively for tasks such as:

* Modeling uncertainty in data
* Making predictions about future events

Key concepts:

* **Probability distributions**: A probability distribution is a function that assigns a probability to each possible value of a random variable.
* **Bayes' theorem**: Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Example:

```python
import scipy.stats as stats

# Create a normal distribution
dist = stats.norm(loc=0, scale=1)

# Compute the probability density function (PDF) of the distribution
pdf = dist.pdf(1)
print(pdf)  # Output: 0.24197072451914337
```

**Practice Task**
-----------------

### Introduction

In this practice task, you will implement a simple neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy. The neural network will consist of two input neurons, two hidden neurons, and one output neuron. The task is to train the neural network to predict the output of a simple function.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Create a new project called `neural_network`.
2. Create a main Python script file called `neural_network.py`.
3. Create a file called `utils.py` to store utility functions.

### Detailed Requirements

1. Implement a `NeuralNetwork` class that has the following methods:
	* `__init__`: Initializes the neural network with the number of input neurons, hidden neurons, and output neurons.
	* `forward`: Computes the output of the neural network given an input.
	* `backward`: Computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the neural network.
	* `train`: Trains the neural network using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
2. Implement a `sigmoid` function that computes the sigmoid of a given input.
3. Implement a `mse` function that computes the mean squared error (MSE) between two vectors.
4. Train the neural network to predict the output of the function `f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2`.

### Expected Output or Behavior

The neural network should be able to predict the output of the function `f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2` with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

### Hints or Tips

* Use the `numpy` library to perform matrix operations.
* Use the `scipy` library to compute the sigmoid and MSE functions.
* Use a learning rate of 0.01 and a number of iterations of 1000.
