# Python Training Plan

## Background

Given the user's experience as an experienced programmer new to Python with a learning goal of becoming an expert in AI and ML, this training plan is tailored to accelerate their learning in Python for AI and ML applications. The plan focuses on practical, hands-on learning with coding exercises and projects, while also covering the necessary theoretical concepts. Each milestone builds upon the previous one, starting with foundational Python skills, then moving to core AI and ML libraries like PyTorch, and finally covering applied AI and ML topics like RAG and agent-based models.
