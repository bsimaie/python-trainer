# Concept Explanations and Practice Task

**Core AI and ML Libraries with PyTorch**
=====================================================

### Concept Explanations

Before diving into the practice task, let's cover some essential concepts related to PyTorch and core AI and ML libraries.

#### 1. PyTorch Basics

PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library for Python. It provides a dynamic computation graph, automatic differentiation, and a modular design, making it an ideal choice for rapid prototyping and research.

*   **Tensors**: The fundamental data structure in PyTorch is the tensor. Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that can be used to represent inputs, outputs, and intermediate results.
*   **Autograd**: PyTorch's Autograd system automatically computes gradients, which are essential for training neural networks.

Example:
```python
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Compute the gradient of x^2 with respect to x
x.requires_grad = True
y = x ** 2
y.sum().backward()
print(x.grad)  # Output: tensor([2., 4., 6.])
```

#### 2. Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are a fundamental concept in deep learning. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process inputs and produce outputs.

*   **Neural Network Architecture**: A neural network's architecture defines its structure, including the number of layers, the type of layers, and the connections between them.
*   **Activation Functions**: Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network, allowing it to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.

Example:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple neural network
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(5, 10)  # input layer (5) -> hidden layer (10)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 5)  # hidden layer (10) -> output layer (5)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))  # activation function for hidden layer
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

net = Net()
```

#### 3. Computer Vision with PyTorch

Computer vision is a field of AI that deals with image and video processing. PyTorch provides several libraries and tools for computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

*   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: CNNs are a type of neural network designed for image processing. They use convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from images.
*   **Image Classification**: Image classification is a common computer vision task that involves assigning a label to an image based on its content.

Example:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])
trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Define a simple CNN for image classification
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

net = Net()
```
