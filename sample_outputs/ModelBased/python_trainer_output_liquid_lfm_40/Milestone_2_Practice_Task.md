# Concept Explanations:
1. Introduction to AI and ML:
   - Machine Learning is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.
   - AI and ML involve the study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.
   - Examples include self-driving cars, spam filtering, and more.

2. Types of Machine Learning:
   - Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from a training dataset where the correct output is provided.
   - Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm tries to learn the structure of the data without any pre-existing labels.
   - Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns from its own actions and how they affect the environment.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - This involves cleaning the data, dealing with missing values, normalizing the data, etc.
   - It is a crucial step before feeding the data to the model as it directly affects the performance of the model.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - This step involves assessing how well the model performs on unseen data.
   - Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.

5. Basics of Neural Networks:
   - Neural Networks are a series of algorithms that endeavor to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.
   - A neural network takes in data, transforms it, and produces an output.

# Practice Task:
a. Task Introduction:
   - You will build a simple machine learning model using Python and Scikit-learn library to predict house prices based on various features.

b. Project Setup:
   - Create a new Python project and name the main Python script file "house_price_prediction.py".
   - You will need the Scikit-learn library, so make sure to install it using pip.

c. Detailed Requirements:
   1. Load the house price dataset.
   2. Clean and preprocess the data (remove missing values, normalize the data, etc.).
   3. Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set.
   4. Train a simple linear regression model on the training set.
   5. Evaluate the model on the testing set using the mean squared error (MSE) as the evaluation metric.

d. Expected Output:
   - The script should print out the MSE of the model on the testing set.

e. Hints/Tips:
   - Use the `train_test_split` function from Scikit-learn to split the dataset.
   - Use the `LinearRegression` class from Scikit-learn to train the model.
   - Use the `mean_squared_error` function from Scikit-learn to calculate the MSE.
