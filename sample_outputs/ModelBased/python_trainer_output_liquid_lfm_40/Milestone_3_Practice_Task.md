# Concept Explanations and Practice Task

# Concept Explanations:

1. **PyTorch Basics:**
   - PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library that provides a platform for developing and training deep learning models. It provides a dynamic computational graph which allows the user to change the graph during runtime.
   - A **tensor** is the core data structure of PyTorch. It's a multi-dimensional array that can be used to represent a batch of images, a single image, a batch of text, a single word, etc.
   - **Autograd** is a package in PyTorch that provides automatic differentiation. It's used to compute gradients of tensors with respect to other tensors.

2. **Building Neural Networks:**
   - In PyTorch, a neural network is built using the `nn.Module` class. This class provides the `forward` method where the user defines the architecture of the network.
   - The `nn.Module` class also provides methods to add layers such as `nn.Linear`, `nn.Conv2d`, `nn.MaxPool2d`, `nn.ReLU`, etc.

3. **Working with Tensors:**
   - Tensors in PyTorch can be created using functions like `torch.randn`, `torch.rand`, `torch.zeros`, `torch.ones`, etc.
   - Tensors can be manipulated using various operations such as `matmul`, `dot`, `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, etc.

4. **Training and Inference:**
   - **Training** involves feeding the model with training data and computing the loss. The gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters are then computed using the `backward` function of PyTorch. These gradients are then used to update the model parameters using an optimizer like `torch.optim.SGD`.
   - **Inference** involves feeding the trained model with new data and using it to make predictions.

5. **Advanced Topics in PyTorch:**
   - **Data Augmentation:** This involves creating new training data by applying transformations to existing data. It can help in reducing overfitting.
   - **Transfer Learning:** This involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point and then fine-tuning it on a new task.
   - **Regularization:** Techniques such as dropout and weight decay can be used to prevent overfitting.

# Practice Task:

1. **Introduction:**
   In this task, you will build a simple neural network using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits.

2. **Project Setup:**
   - Create a new Python project.
   - Name the main Python script file as `mnist_classifier.py`.
   - Install PyTorch using pip: `pip install torch`.

3. **Task Requirements:**
   - The neural network should have 784 input neurons (for the 28x28 pixel images), 128 hidden neurons, and 10 output neurons (for the 10 digits).
   - Use the `torch.nn` module for building the neural network.
   - Use the `torch.optim` module for training the network.
   - Use the PyTorch tensor operations to compute the output of the network.
   - Use the `torch.nn.functional` module for applying activation functions.

4. **Expected Output:**
   - The model should be able to classify the MNIST digits with reasonable accuracy.

5. **Hints:**
   - Use the `torchvision.datasets` module to load the MNIST dataset.
   - Normalize the pixel values of the images to the range [0, 1].
   - Use the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.
