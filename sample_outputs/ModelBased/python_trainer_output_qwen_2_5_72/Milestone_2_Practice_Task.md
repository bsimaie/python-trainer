# Concept Explanations and Practice Task

# Practice Task for "Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn"

## 1. Concept Explanations

### Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: This type of machine learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common supervised learning tasks include classification (predicting a category) and regression (predicting a continuous value).
  - **Example**: Predicting house prices based on features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: This type of machine learning involves training a model on an unlabeled dataset, where the goal is to infer the structure of the data. Common unsupervised learning tasks include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of features).
  - **Example**: Grouping customers into segments based on their purchasing behavior.

### Model Evaluation and Validation
- **Model Evaluation**: The process of assessing the performance of a machine learning model. Common evaluation metrics for classification include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. For regression, common metrics include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.
- **Validation Techniques**: Methods to ensure that a model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Common techniques include:
  - **Train-Test Split**: Splitting the dataset into a training set and a test set to evaluate the model's performance.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Dividing the dataset into multiple subsets (folds) and training the model on different combinations of these folds to get a more robust estimate of performance.

### Scikit-Learn Workflow
- **Loading Data**: Using `pandas` to load and preprocess datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Model Selection**: Choosing the appropriate model for the task (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, SVM).
- **Training the Model**: Fitting the model to the training data using the `fit` method.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model on the test set using appropriate metrics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using techniques like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

## 2. Practice Task

### a. Task Introduction
In this task, you will work on a supervised learning problem using Scikit-Learn. You will build a model to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on their usage and demographic data. This task will help you understand the Scikit-Learn workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

### b. Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Create a New Project**:
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
   - Initialize a new Python virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
     - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - Install the necessary packages: `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`

2. **Name the Main Python Script File**:
   - Create a file named `churn_prediction.py`.

3. **List Any Additional Files Needed**:
   - Download the dataset from a public source (e.g., Kaggle) or use the provided sample dataset.
   - Save the dataset in the same directory as your script and name it `churn_data.csv`.

### c. Detailed Requirements for the Task
- **Data Loading**:
  - Load the dataset using `pandas`.
  - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values (e.g., fill with the mean or drop rows/columns).
  - Encode categorical variables (e.g., convert 'gender' to numerical values).
  - Scale numerical features (e.g., using `StandardScaler`).
- **Model Selection**:
  - Choose a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- **Training the Model**:
  - Split the data into training and test sets.
  - Train the model on the training set.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Use grid search to find the best hyperparameters for your model.

### d. Expected Output or Behavior
- The script should print the evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for the model on the test set.
- Optionally, you can plot a confusion matrix to visualize the performance.

### e. Hints or Tips for Completing the Task
- Use `pandas` for data manipulation and `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks.
- Refer to the Scikit-Learn documentation for detailed information on model parameters and functions.
- Use `matplotlib` for plotting the confusion matrix if desired.
