# Concept Explanations and Practice Task

# Specialized Applications: RAG and Agents

## 1. Concept Explanations

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models to improve the quality and accuracy of generated text. In a RAG system:
- **Retrieval Component**: Uses a dense vector space to retrieve relevant documents or passages from a large corpus.
- **Generative Component**: Uses a pre-trained language model to generate text based on the retrieved documents and the input query.

**Example**: Suppose you are building a chatbot that needs to answer questions about a specific domain (e.g., medical advice). The retrieval component would find relevant medical documents, and the generative component would use these documents to craft a detailed and accurate response.

### Building Intelligent Agents
**Intelligent Agents** are software entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of AI, these agents often use reinforcement learning to improve their performance over time.

**Example**: A reinforcement learning agent that plays a game (e.g., chess) learns to make better moves by receiving rewards or penalties based on the outcomes of its actions.

### Integration with Real-World Applications
**Real-World Integration** involves deploying AI and ML models in practical scenarios to solve real problems. This includes:
- **Data Ingestion**: Collecting and preprocessing data from various sources.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploying models in production environments.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitoring model performance and making necessary adjustments.

**Example**: A RAG system integrated into a customer support chatbot can dynamically retrieve and generate responses based on the latest customer support documents, ensuring up-to-date and accurate information.

## 2. Practice Task

### Task Introduction
In this task, you will build a simple RAG system that retrieves relevant documents from a small corpus and generates a response to a user query. You will also create a basic intelligent agent that interacts with the RAG system to enhance the user experience.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### a. Setting Up the Project
1. **Create a New Project**:
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Initialize a Python virtual environment:
     ```sh
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Install the necessary libraries:
     ```sh
     pip install transformers faiss-cpu pandas
     ```

3. **Project Structure**:
   - Create the following files:
     - `main.py`: Main script to run the RAG system and the agent.
     - `rag_system.py`: Contains the RAG system logic.
     - `agent.py`: Contains the intelligent agent logic.
     - `data/corpus.txt`: A text file containing the corpus documents.
     - `data/queries.txt`: A text file containing sample user queries.

#### b. Detailed Requirements
1. **RAG System**:
   - Implement a function to load and preprocess the corpus.
   - Implement a function to encode the corpus documents and store them in a FAISS index.
   - Implement a function to retrieve relevant documents for a given query.
   - Implement a function to generate a response using a pre-trained language model.

2. **Intelligent Agent**:
   - Implement a simple rule-based agent that interacts with the RAG system.
   - The agent should:
     - Parse user input.
     - Query the RAG system.
     - Present the generated response to the user.
     - Optionally, provide additional context or follow-up questions.

3. **Integration**:
   - Ensure the agent can read queries from `data/queries.txt` and write responses to a new file `data/responses.txt`.

#### c. Expected Output or Behavior
- The RAG system should retrieve relevant documents and generate a response for each query.
- The agent should interact with the RAG system and provide a seamless user experience.
- The `data/responses.txt` file should contain the responses generated for each query.

#### d. Hints or Tips
- Use the `transformers` library to load pre-trained models and tokenizers.
- Use the `faiss` library to create and manage the document index.
- For the agent, start with simple rule-based logic and consider adding more sophisticated behavior as you become more comfortable.
