# Concept Explanations and Practice Task

### 1. Concept Explanations

#### Basics of Neural Networks
Neural networks are the backbone of deep learning algorithms. They are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that make up animal brains. A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons. Each neuron combines input from the data with a set of coefficients, or weights, that either amplify or dampen that input, thereby assigning significance to inputs for the task the algorithm is trying to learn; e.g., which inputs are most relevant in determining the correct output.

#### Deep Learning with PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. PyTorch provides a platform for building and training neural networks. Its key features include tensor computing with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPUs), a tape-based autograd system for automatic differentiation, and a define-by-run framework, which means that the execution is defined dynamically unlike static graphs in TensorFlow.

#### Advanced Model Architectures
Beyond basic neural networks, advanced model architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image tasks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants like LSTM and GRU for sequence tasks, and Transformers for tasks that require understanding the context of input data like in language processing. These architectures are designed to handle specific types of data and tasks more efficiently than standard neural networks.

### 2. Practice Task

#### Introduction to the Task
You will build a simple neural network using PyTorch to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion products from 10 categories, with each image being 28x28 pixels.

#### Setup
- Create a new project folder named `fashion_mnist_classification`.
- Within this folder, create a Python script file named `neural_network.py`.
- Ensure you have PyTorch installed (`pip install torch torchvision`).

#### Requirements
1. Import the necessary libraries: `torch`, `torchvision`, and `torchvision.transforms`.
2. Load the Fashion-MNIST dataset using `torchvision.datasets` and apply transformations to scale the pixel values to a range of [0, 1].
3. Create a simple neural network with the following architecture:
   - A flatten layer to convert 2D image data to 1D feature vectors.
   - Two linear layers with ReLU activation.
   - An output layer with 10 neurons (for each class) and log-softmax activation.
4. Define a loss function (e.g., `nn.NLLLoss()`) and an optimizer (e.g., `optim.Adam()`).
5. Train the neural network for several epochs, printing out the loss for each epoch.
6. After training, evaluate the model on the test set and print the average loss and accuracy.

#### Expected Output
The script should output the training loss for each epoch, and after training, it should output the test loss and accuracy. For example:

```
Training loss: 2.3026
Training loss: 2.2978
...
Test loss: 0.3412
Accuracy: 88%
```

#### Hints
- Pay attention to the shape of your tensors, especially after the flatten layer.
- Remember to zero the gradients (`optimizer.zero_grad()`) at the start of each training iteration to prevent accumulation of gradients across iterations.
- Use `with torch.no_grad():` block for evaluation to prevent computation of gradients.
