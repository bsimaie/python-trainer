## Concept Explanations

### Introduction to Neural Networks
Neural networks are a set of algorithms modeled after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text, or time series, must be translated.

**Example:** A simple neural network can be used to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The network takes an image of a digit as input and outputs the corresponding digit (0-9).

### PyTorch Basics
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It provides a flexible and efficient platform for building and training neural networks.

**Example:** In PyTorch, you can define a tensor (a multi-dimensional array) and perform operations on it. For instance, `torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])` creates a 1D tensor with values [1.0, 2.0, 3.0].

### Building and Training Neural Networks
Building a neural network involves defining the architecture (layers, activation functions, etc.) and training it using a dataset. Training involves feeding the network with data, computing the loss, and adjusting the weights to minimize the loss.

**Example:** A simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer can be defined in PyTorch as follows:
```python
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
```
