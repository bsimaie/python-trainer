# Concept Explanations and Practice Task

# Applied AI and ML Projects: Practice Task

## 1. Concept Explanations

### 1.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**RAG** is a technique that combines retrieval-based and generation-based methods in natural language processing (NLP). It involves retrieving relevant information from a large corpus and then generating a response based on that information. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like question answering, where the model needs to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

**Example:**
Imagine you have a large database of articles. When a user asks a question, the RAG model first retrieves the most relevant articles and then generates a response based on the content of those articles.

**Real-World Application:**
RAG is used in chatbots, virtual assistants, and search engines to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

### 1.2 AI Agents
**AI Agents** are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They can be used in various applications, from game playing to autonomous driving.

**Example:**
In a game, an AI agent might analyze the current state of the game, decide on the best move, and then execute that move.

**Real-World Application:**
AI agents are used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and decision-making systems in various industries.

### 1.3 End-to-End ML Projects
**End-to-End ML Projects** involve the complete lifecycle of a machine learning project, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment. This approach ensures that the model is robust and can be used in real-world applications.

**Example:**
An end-to-end project might involve collecting data on customer reviews, preprocessing the data, training a sentiment analysis model, evaluating its performance, and deploying it to a web application.

**Real-World Application:**
End-to-end ML projects are used in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, to build predictive models and automate decision-making processes.

## 2. Practice Task

### 2.1 Introduction to the Task
In this task, you will build a simple AI agent that uses RAG to answer questions based on a given corpus of text documents. The agent will retrieve relevant documents and generate a response based on the content of those documents. This task will help you apply the concepts of RAG, AI agents, and end-to-end ML projects in a practical setting.

### 2.2 Step-by-Step Instructions on How to Set Up the Project

#### a. Create a New Project
- Create a new directory for your project.
- Name the directory `RAG_AI_Agent`.

#### b. Main Python Script File
- Inside the `RAG_AI_Agent` directory, create a Python script file named `rag_agent.py`.

#### c. Additional Files Needed
- Create a directory named `data` inside the `RAG_AI_Agent` directory.
- Place a few text documents (e.g., `.txt` files) in the `data` directory. These documents will serve as your corpus.

### 2.3 Detailed Requirements for the Task

1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Implement a function that retrieves the most relevant documents from the corpus based on a given query.
   - Use a simple text similarity measure (e.g., cosine similarity) to rank the documents.

2. **Response Generation:**
   - Implement a function that generates a response based on the retrieved documents.
   - You can use a simple rule-based approach or a basic language model (e.g., GPT-2) for generating the response.

3. **AI Agent:**
   - Implement an AI agent that takes a user query as input, retrieves the relevant documents, and generates a response.
   - The agent should be able to handle multiple queries in a loop.

4. **End-to-End Workflow:**
   - Ensure that the entire process is encapsulated in an end-to-end workflow, from querying to response generation.

### 2.4 Expected Output or Behavior
- When you run the `rag_agent.py` script, it should prompt the user to enter a query.
- The script should then retrieve the most relevant documents from the corpus and generate a response based on those documents.
- The response should be printed to the console.
- The script should continue to prompt the user for new queries until the user decides to exit.

### 2.5 Hints or Tips for Completing the Task
- Start by implementing the data retrieval function. You can use libraries like `scikit-learn` for text similarity measures.
- For response generation, consider using a pre-trained language model like GPT-2 from the `transformers` library by Hugging Face.
- Test your AI agent with different queries to ensure it retrieves relevant documents and generates accurate responses.
