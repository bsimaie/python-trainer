# Concept Explanations and Practice Task

# Introduction to Machine Learning Practice Task

## 1. Concept Explanations

### Basic ML Concepts
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data. The goal is to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. ML algorithms can be broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

### Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can be used to predict the output for new inputs. Examples include regression and classification tasks.
  - **Example**: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it. The goal is to discover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
  - **Example**: Grouping customers into segments based on their purchasing behavior.

### Introduction to Scikit-Learn
Scikit-Learn is a popular Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, and offers a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

- **Example**: Using Scikit-Learn to train a simple linear regression model to predict house prices.

## 2. Practice Task

### a. Introduction to the Task
In this task, you will build a simple machine learning model using Scikit-Learn to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features. This task will help you understand the basics of supervised learning and how to use Scikit-Learn to implement a classification model.

### b. Step-by-Step Instructions on How to Set Up the Project

1. **Create a New Project**: Start by creating a new directory for your project.
2. **Main Python Script File**: Name the main Python script file `iris_classification.py`.
3. **Additional Files**: No additional files are needed for this task.

### c. Detailed Requirements for the Task

1. **Load the Dataset**: Use Scikit-Learn's built-in `load_iris` function to load the iris dataset.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
3. **Choose a Model**: Select a classification model (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, or `KNeighborsClassifier`).
4. **Train the Model**: Train the model on the training data.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using metrics like accuracy.
6. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

### d. Expected Output or Behavior

- The script should output the accuracy of the model on the test data.
- The script should also print the predicted species for a few sample inputs.

### e. Hints or Tips for Completing the Task

- Start by importing the necessary libraries: `sklearn.datasets`, `sklearn.model_selection`, `sklearn.linear_model`, and `sklearn.metrics`.
- Use `train_test_split` with a test size of 0.3 to split the data.
- Experiment with different classification models to see which one performs best.
- Use `accuracy_score` from `sklearn.metrics` to evaluate the model's performance.
